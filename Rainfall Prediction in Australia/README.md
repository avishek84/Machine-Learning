<p><strong><u>Description:</u></strong><br><br>Predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow.</p>
<p><strong><u>Content:</u></strong><br><br>This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.<br><br>RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.</p>

    <li>Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook has been used to do the project.</li>
    <li>Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and developed a model for predicting RainTomorrow (or whether it will rain tomorrow).</li>
    <li>Used Logistic Regression, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, SVC, CatBoost, XGBClassifier for model building.</li>
